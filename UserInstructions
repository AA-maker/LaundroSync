Parts of the program simulate what it would be like to access a normal laundry room, while other parts are actual features of the app. The program will display all these 
different features to the user. First the program will show the login feature of the app, where users can login with 3 attempts for both the username and password.
Then, the machine checking and registering system will be put on display to show how a user may check if a specified machine is open and then simulate registering it.
Finally, the timer and notification system for the program is shown. The program here presents a simulated version to save time, so a 10 second timer is set and at the 
end of it a notification similar to what a user might receive will be sent to the user's device letting them know their laundry is done. The entire system is implemented
using an already built graphical user interface (JOptionPane).
